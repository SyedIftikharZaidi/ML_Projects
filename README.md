<h3> Description </h3> 
 A Malicious and phishing detection based system which is providing us the analysis about specific large dataset based on more than 600000 URLS, in which we are getting output 
 in 4 categories with their statistics: 
 [phishing,benign, defacement,malware].
 We did analysis on 3 different machine learning algorithms (XGBoost, Random Forest, Light BGM Classifier) on the basis of score and accuracy of each.

 <h6>Suggestion: </h6>
 Its would be better if you set up virtual environment for this project and install all python packages and libraries into that & run this on your jupyter notebook.
